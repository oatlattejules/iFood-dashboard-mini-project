# iFood-dashboard-mini-project
This project explores iFood consumer data to analyze campaign performance, consumer demographics, and spending patterns across income levels. My goal was to practice Tableau to create interactive dashboards to uncover actionable insights. 

# Project Files

ifood_dashboards_slides.pptx - Powerpoint export of final dashboards (not interactive)
ifood_project.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook data cleaning/processing

# View Dashboards
[View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/ifood_dashboards/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

# Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy) for data cleaning and transformation  
Tableau for interactive dashboards and visualizations 

# Insights

- Analyzed customer income distribution across education level, marital status, and household size
- Identified high-value spending categories based on income
